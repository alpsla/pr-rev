# PR Reviewer Technical Stack

## Core Technologies

### Frontend (apps/web)
- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **UI Components**: 
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - shadcn/ui for component library
  - Radix UI for accessible primitives
- **State Management**: 
  - TanStack Query (React Query) for API state
  - Zustand for local state
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend (apps/api)
- **Framework**: Node.js with Express
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **API Layer**:
  - OpenAPI/Swagger for documentation
  - Zod for runtime type validation
  - Express middleware for request handling
- **Database**: 
  - PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
  - Redis for caching

### Monorepo Structure
- **Build System**: Turborepo
  - Optimized build caching
  - Pipeline orchestration
  - Workspace management
- **Package Manager**: pnpm
  - Efficient dependency management
  - Fast installation
  - Disk space optimization

### Development Tools
- **Code Quality**:
  - ESLint for linting
  - Prettier for formatting
  - Husky for git hooks
  - Commitlint for commit messages
- **Testing**:
  - Jest for unit testing
  - React Testing Library for component testing
  - Cypress for E2E testing
  - MSW for API mocking

### Observability Stack
- **Logging**: 
  - Winston for structured logging
  - Log rotation and management
- **Error Tracking**: 
  - Sentry for error monitoring
  - Stack trace analysis
  - User impact tracking
- **Performance Monitoring**:
  - OpenTelemetry for tracing
  - Prometheus for metrics
  - Grafana for visualization

### CI/CD
- **GitHub Actions** for:
  - Automated testing
  - Build verification
  - Deployment pipelines
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Infrastructure as Code** using Terraform

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Foundation
1. Set up Turborepo monorepo structure
2. Initialize Next.js frontend with TypeScript
3. Configure Express backend with OpenAPI
4. Establish basic CI/CD pipeline

### Phase 2: Core Features
1. Implement PR analysis engine
2. Set up database schema with Prisma
3. Create basic UI components
4. Integrate authentication system

### Phase 3: Observability
1. Configure logging and error tracking
2. Set up performance monitoring
3. Implement API analytics
4. Deploy monitoring dashboards

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Feature-based folder structure
- Shared types in packages/types
- Common utilities in packages/utils
- Reusable UI components in packages/ui

### Development Workflow
1. Branch naming: feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/
2. PR template with checklist
3. Automated code review checks
4. Required PR approvals

### Performance Considerations
- API response caching
- Static page generation where possible
- Image optimization
- Bundle size monitoring
