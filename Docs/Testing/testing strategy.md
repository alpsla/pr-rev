Test Architecture Issues:


Too many interdependent mocks and utilities
Different variations of similar interfaces
Inconsistent mock data structures
Complex test helpers that are hard to maintain


Testing Approach Issues:


Trying to test too many things at once
Mixing unit, integration, and contract tests without clear boundaries
Overlapping test utilities and helpers
No clear testing strategy from the start

Proposed Rules for New Implementation:

Test Structure:


Clear separation between unit, integration, and contract tests
One consistent way to mock external dependencies
Single source of truth for mock data
Clear naming conventions for test files and cases


Mock Management:


Create a single, well-documented mock factory
Use TypeScript to enforce mock data structure
Avoid multiple variations of similar mocks
Keep mock data minimal and focused


Test Utils:


Create reusable, simple test utilities
Avoid complex test helpers that try to do too much
Document utility functions clearly
Keep utils focused on single responsibility


Development Process:


Start with a clear testing strategy
Write tests incrementally
Refactor tests when they become complex
Regular reviews of test architecture
