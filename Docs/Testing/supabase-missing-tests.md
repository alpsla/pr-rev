# Missing Test Coverage for Supabase Integration

## Authentication Tests
1. Session Management
   - Session persistence
   - Session expiration handling
   - Token refresh flow
   - Auth state synchronization

## Data Synchronization
1. Real-time Updates
   - Subscription to changes
   - Real-time data propagation
   - Connection recovery
   - Event handling

## Advanced Query Tests
1. Complex Queries
   - Filter combinations
   - Range queries
   - Full-text search
   - Sorting with multiple criteria

2. Batch Operations
   - Bulk inserts
   - Transaction handling
   - Rollback scenarios
   - Conflict resolution

## Edge Cases
1. Rate Limiting
   - Request throttling
   - Quota management
   - Retry mechanisms

2. Data Validation
   - Schema validation
   - Custom validation rules
   - Foreign key constraints
   - Unique constraint handling

## Security Tests
1. Row Level Security (RLS)
   - Policy enforcement
   - Role-based access
   - Dynamic policy evaluation

2. API Security
   - Token validation
   - CORS handling
   - Request signing
   - API key rotation

## Integration Points
1. GitHub Integration
   - Platform configuration sync
   - Repository settings sync
   - Permission mapping

2. Analysis Integration
   - Language detection sync
   - Analysis rules sync
   - Configuration propagation

## Performance Edge Cases
1. Large Dataset Handling
   - Pagination implementation
   - Infinite scroll behavior
   - Large result sets
   - Memory management

2. Concurrent Access
   - Lock management
   - Race condition handling
   - Deadlock prevention

## Error Recovery
1. Connection Issues
   - Offline mode behavior
   - Data queue management
   - Sync recovery
   - Conflict resolution

2. Data Integrity
   - Corrupted data handling
   - Schema migration errors
   - Version conflicts
   - Data repair mechanisms

## Implementation Priority
High Priority:
1. Authentication flows
2. Basic CRUD operations
3. Error handling
4. Security policies

Medium Priority:
1. Real-time updates
2. Complex queries
3. Performance optimization
4. Integration sync

Low Priority:
1. Advanced edge cases
2. Batch operations
3. Advanced security
4. Performance edge cases

## Notes
- These tests should be implemented gradually as features are developed
- Focus on critical path functionality first
- Consider automated testing for repeatable scenarios
- Document workarounds for currently untested features
